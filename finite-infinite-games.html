                <p><em>Q: Why did you run today? A: Because I want to run again tomorrow.</em></p>
                <p>The book <em>Finite and Infinite Games</em> by James P. Carse is an exploration of motivation and
                    livelihood.
                    The main thesis is that one can approach any of their pursuits, and life in general, through one of
                    two lenses:</p>
                <p><strong>Finite games</strong> - A finite game has one clear goal, a beginning and an end, a winner
                    and a loser. The goal of the finite game is to win the game.</p>
                <p><strong>Infinite games</strong> - An infinite game has no fixed end, no winner and no clear
                    outcome. The goal of the infinite game is to continue playing the game.</p>


                <p>Sports are typically viewed as the quintessential finite game - each team is trying to win the game,
                    there are clear and unchanging rules, and the game ends when the buzzer sounds. The classic example
                    of an infinite game is a relationship - ideally there is no end, and the goal is to deepen the
                    experience and continue the relationship.</p>
                <p>The author argues that viewing the world through the lens of the infinite game leads to deeper
                    relationships, a greater sense of ownership in one’s pursuits and ultimately a more fulfilling life.
                    For example, the business owner who is only concerned about maximizing Q2 profits is probably much
                    less happy than the one who loves owning their business so much that their core goal is for the
                    business to continue to exist! The athlete who only cares about winning next week’s game is less
                    fulfilled than the one who just wants to keep playing the game.</p>

                <h3>Endurance Sport</h3>


                <p>Endurance sports are uniquely awesome in that it’s possible to perform at a high level at any stage
                    in life.<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1" style="text-decoration:none;">1</a></sup> There’s no other
                    sport where it’s possible to peak in your 40s and truly compete into your 80s.<sup id="fnref2"><a
                            href="#fn2" style="text-decoration:none;">2</a></sup> This makes endurance sport uniquely
                    positioned to be played as an infinite game. A perfectly valid reason to run every day is to make
                    sure that you’re able to run every day!<sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3"
                            style="text-decoration:none;">3</a></sup></p>
                <p>Now here’s the problem with strictly taking the long view - you still need to get your ass out the
                    door every day.</p>
                <p>How many people do you know who are only motivated to exercise because they “try to stay healthy”?
                    I’m willing to bet that: 1) you know a lot of these people and 2) they’re the least healthy people
                    you know. There may be exceptions, but most of us need a goal with a short time frame to stay
                    disciplined and convince ourselves to go through some discomfort. It’s the marathon you have in 6
                    weeks and the goal of crushing a PB, not “overall health and longevity” that keeps you from hitting
                    snooze when it’s 6am, it’s cold and your legs are sore.</p>
                <p>So I propose the following framework:</p>
                <p><strong>Endurance sports can be viewed as an infinite series of finite games.</strong></p>
                <p>Or, rather: the infinite goal of endurance sport is to keep finding finite goals to pursue.</p>
                <p>The two goals must be present at the same time. If you are only motivated by extrinsic, short term
                    goals, you won’t enjoy the process of getting there - and once you do get there, what’s next?<sup
                        id="fnref4"><a href="#fn4" style="text-decoration:none;">4</a></sup> If you have no short term
                    goals and are only motivated by continued participation, you’re not going to get the most out of
                    yourself.</p>

                <h3>Reframing</h3>

                <figure style="float: right; margin-left: 2em; margin-bottom: 1em; max-width: 40%;">
                    <img src="images/finite_infinite.png"
                        alt="A diagram showing the continuum of motivation from finite to infinite games"
                        style="width: 100%; height: auto; border: 1px solid #ddd; padding: 4px; background-color: #fff;">
                    <figcaption
                        style="font-style: italic; font-size: 0.9em; text-align: center; color: #666; margin-top: 0.5em;">
                        The continuum of motivation - each athlete should not exist at a single place on the continuum,
                        but instead have simultaneous goals that span the continuum.
                    </figcaption>
                </figure>
                <p>In my first 5-6 years of running, there was a point in each build when I told myself that this
                    marathon would be my last one, at least for a while. Training was too hard, it ate up too much of my
                    time and energy, and I had to make too many sacrifices to achieve my goals. Of course, immediately
                    after each race I would sign up for another one, as I was riding the high of accomplishment and
                    motivated to continue to improve my times.</p>
                <p>Years later, I have accepted that I won’t just quit racing one day; endurance sport is a central part
                    of my lifestyle, and that’s exactly what I want. This reframing means that hard training days aren’t
                    feared and viewed as a “grind” - they’re just part of the sport that I really like doing.<sup
                        id="fnref5"><a href="#fn5" style="text-decoration:none;">5</a></sup></p>
                <p>My current fear is that my motivations have swung too far toward the infinite - I used to get
                    incredibly nervous before every race, and that was a good thing.<sup id="fnref6"><a href="#fn6"
                            style="text-decoration:none;">6</a></sup> It meant I cared and it brought out the best in
                    me. That feeling isn’t gone, but it doesn’t come as easy as it used to. In the past few years I have
                    shown up to a few races without the nerves, without the ‘edge’ - and that’s the last thing you need
                    with 3km to go when it really starts hurting. But I have also had some great races where I felt the
                    same butterflies as I did in the early years. The challenge for me, and for all of us, is to
                    continue to find goals that are deeply meaningful, that keep you up at night and get you out of bed
                    in the morning. That’s the infinite game.</p>

                    <li id="fn6">This may seem a bit counterintuitive - for many, feeling nervous before a big event has
                        an association with a lack of experience or preparedness. But even at the highest level of
                        sport, pre-competition nerves can be a sign of intensity and focus. Bill Russell would routinely
                        get so nervous before playoff games that he would <a
