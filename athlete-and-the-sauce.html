        <p>I used to love drinking beer.</p>
        <p>I still love drinking beer, but I used to, too.<sup id="fnref1"><a href="#fn1"
              style="text-decoration:none;">1</a></sup></p>
        <p>I also love running fast. And herein lies the problem. </p>
        <p>Back in my early 20's, I could hit the bars on Saturday night, set the alarm for 8, wake up, dust myself off,
          and get my 12 miles in on Sunday morning. It doesn't work like that anymore; now I find that I can have one
          beer without feeling any ill effects, but after having a second (and anything beyond that) I'll really start
          to notice the interrupted sleep and recovery, and I'll feel sluggish on my runs for a day or two. I also tend
          to gain weight easily, and the quickest way to do this is to add regular barley sandwiches to the diet. </p>
        <p><em>Ok, so there's an easy solution. When you want to drink, just have one beer and stop.</em></p>
        <p>Well... personally, I find that strategy to be much easier said than done. I grew up in a culture where binge
          drinking was the norm, and some of that DNA remains.<sup id="fnref2"><a href="#fn2"
              style="text-decoration:none;">2</a></sup> I find myself in many situations where I find it difficult to
          have one beer and stop - not because of any explicit peer pressure, but often because I'm having a good time
          and want it to keep rolling, and mentally the "seal is broken". It's very easy to convince yourself that just
          ONE more drink isn't going to make a big difference, and before you know it you've had 4 or 5.</p>
        <p><em>So just give up drinking then. It's not good for you anyway.</em></p>
        <p>Well… I don't want to do that. It's popular for fitness influencers these days to dunk on alcohol for all of
          its negative health effects.<sup id="fnref3"><a href="#fn3" style="text-decoration:none;">3</a></sup> But in
          my experience, social drinking can be… really
          fun. It can make it easier to make new friends, and it can solidify the bonds you have with old friends. These
          things are extremely important to me.</p>
        <p>I'm at the age where I'm going to multiple weddings and/or bachelor parties per year. I want to be there for
          my closest friends the way they were there for me at those major life events - and in most cases that means
          showing up and partying hard.<sup id="fnref4"><a href="#fn4" style="text-decoration:none;">4</a></sup> In
          2023, I had a close friend's bachelor party 2 weeks before the Glass City Marathon. I went but I didn't drink,
          and I left the bars early - this decision caused pretty intense feelings of guilt, both at the time and now. I
          felt selfish for prioritizing my race over my friend, and I'm still not sure if I made the right decision.</p>
        <p>It might look a little different for you - maybe it's a weekly bowling league or wine with family dinners
          that you don't want to give up. Everyone's situation is different, but most of us will be forced to make
          decisions between prioritizing our athletic goals and our social lives.</p>
        <p><em>So what the hell are we supposed to do?</em></p>
        <p>We are athletes but we are also human beings, and human beings are social animals. A life of giving in to
          every temptation is one where we are rudderless and unfulfilled. But a life that is purely the cold, logical
          optimization of athletic performance will leave us burnt out and isolated. We need to find a way to strike a
          balance between prioritizing our athletic goals and maintaining our social lives - in the best cases these two
          lives work hand in hand.<sup id="fnref5"><a href="#fn5" style="text-decoration:none;">5</a></sup></p>
        <p>So here is my (imperfect) two-step strategy that I created and (imperfectly) implement in my own training:
        </p>
        <p><strong>In Season</strong></p>
        <p>Define a cut-off day before a goal race, and don't drink at all after that day.<br><br>It's way easier for me
          to show up at the beginning of a night and say "I have a race coming up, I'm not drinking tonight" than it is
          to navigate the "should I have one more beer" decision on a minute-by-minute basis. If your friends are like
          mine, they will give you shit for a minute or two and then move right on.<br><br>So I just pick a date before
          a goal race, and it's a non-negotiable matter that I won't drink between that date and the race. In the past I
          did one month, but now that my 30+-year-old social lifestyle is a little less alcohol-centric, I can pretty
          easily go 12 or 14 weeks before a race without drinking. I find that these extended dry periods make me feel
          super sharp on race day, and make me value the off-season beers even more.</p>
        <p><strong>Off-season</strong></p>
        <p>Outside of the dry periods, (sometimes) drink with the people you truly value.<br><br>I don't tend to regret
          the nights when I let loose and drink with my closest friends and family: Post-race beers with teammates, the
          holidays, the aforementioned weddings and bachelor parties, etc. The times when I wake up the next day feeling
          sluggish and annoyed at myself are the times when I didn't really need to drink: slightly awkward work events,
          situations where I was meeting new people and (unnecessarily) felt tacit social pressure to have a few drinks,
          etc.<br><br>I try to be intentional about when I drink. I pick my spots. And on special occasions I decide
          beforehand that I'm going to drink, and do it guilt-free.<sup id="fnref6"><a href="#fn6"
              style="text-decoration:none;">6</a></sup> I don't always get it right, but just reminding myself to think
          about the trade-off between athletic performance and social bonding is enough to get me to drink less often in
          situations where I didn't need to, and feel less guilt in situations where I do drink.</p>
        <p>My system isn't perfect, and I don't even stick to it 100% of the time. And sometimes I wonder if I'm taking
          myself too seriously - maybe I'll look back in 20 years and regret the early nights and missed opportunities
          to drink, laugh and hang out. But in trying to find the balance between being a running-monk and a complete
          hedonist, I've found that creating a system and doing my best to adhere to it has been greatly helpful. I
          recommend taking some time to consider your situation and be deliberate in creating your own system.</p>

          <li id="fn2">In my university days, having double-digit drinks multiple times every week was not considered
            out of the ordinary in my social circle. Unsurprisingly, these years were not my athletic peak. In fact,
            they were undoubtedly my athletic trough. <a href="#fnref2" style="text-decoration:none;">&#8617;</a></li>
          <li id="fn3">And to be fair, research pretty clearly establishes a link between alcohol use and <a

          <li id="fn4">Skeptics may say that you can go to these things and "still have fun" without drinking. And this
            is true. But in my experience it's impossible to argue that being the one sober guy doesn't change the vibe.
